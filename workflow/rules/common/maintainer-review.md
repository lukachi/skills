# Maintainer review

OKF records provenance, trust, and lifecycle; it does not provide an approval
process. Follow the project review protocol in `PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md`.

Require an explicit maintainer decision before:

- choosing a workflow route when significance is ambiguous;
- starting raw processing, whole-project reconstruction, durable external
  research, semantic curation, or broad direction shaping when the maintainer
  did not already request that outcome;
- implementing a significant spec whose outcome, scope, exclusions, acceptance
  criteria, or material decisions have not already been explicitly accepted;
- selecting current truth when evidence cannot resolve chronology or authority;
- accepting material re-scoping, unresolved risk, or a completion claim;
- recording `verified` by a `human:<id>` actor.

Do not request review for freezing a clean Git raw scope, file accounting, QMD
refresh, index or log maintenance, or source-backed drafts that keep their
trust state honest. Raw intake itself never counts as evidence.

Present a compact review packet containing the exact decision, evidence,
conflicts, recommendation, and requested response. Record approve, correct, or
defer. Ask one focused question at a time. Silence is not approval.

## Write the decision for the product owner

The maintainer decides what the product should be. They are not reading to
check the investigation, and they do not hold the file layout, the type names,
or yesterday's discovery numbering in their head. A packet written as if they
do forces them to reconstruct the product meaning out of engineering artifacts
before they can answer, and the usual outcome is not a wrong decision but no
decision at all.

Order the packet so the decision is answerable from the top:

1. **What happens today**, in the words a person using or operating the product
   would use. No file paths, no symbol names, no identifiers the product's own
   language does not contain.
2. **What is in doubt**, stated as a product question rather than an
   implementation observation.
3. **What each answer means** — what gets recorded, what changes, what does not.
   Reconstruction never edits source, so say plainly that no answer here fixes
   anything by itself.
4. **The recommendation**, one option named, with its cost.
5. **The evidence**, last and clearly separable, addressed by claim or discovery
   id for anyone who wants to audit it.

Detail is not the problem and must not be dropped; its position is. Depth that
arrives before the question buries it, and the same depth below a stated
question supports it.

Translate rather than cite. A term that exists only in the implementation gets
replaced by what it does for the product, with the original in parentheses at
most once. If a decision genuinely cannot be stated without engineering
vocabulary, that is a finding rather than a licence: the capability has no
product-level description yet, and recording that gap is part of the answer.

One decision per packet. Several stacked in one message read as a status report
and get answered as none of them.

For significant work, record framing and completion decisions with `wfctl work
approve <id> --stage framing|completion --by human:<maintainer-id>`. That
command needs an interactive terminal, or an out-of-band `--token` matching
`WFCTL_APPROVAL_TOKEN`; it writes both the `maintainer_review` receipt and the
durable approval record the completion gate checks. Never hand-write
`maintainer_review.status`, `by`, `at`, `method`, or `receipt`: a hand-written
receipt fails verification. Existing explicit maintainer instructions may
satisfy the framing decision, but still record it through the command; do not
ask for the same decision twice. Reopen the gate when the approved framing
changes materially.

Approving edits the change record, so re-read it, refresh its review receipt,
and refresh the checkpoint afterwards.

After every material maintainer turn, update the spec's mutable current state
and append the decision/discussion ledger before continuing. Preserve proposed,
approved, rejected, deferred, and superseded outcomes without copying the
conversation transcript.
