# Smell baseline

The fixed set of code smells the Standards axis carries even when a repository
documents nothing (Fowler, _Refactoring_, ch. 3). Two rules bind it:

- **The repository overrides.** A documented repository standard always wins.
  Where it endorses something the baseline would flag, suppress the smell. What
  each bound repository declares about itself is printed by `wfctl work
  repositories <id>`.
- **Always a judgement call.** Each smell is a labelled heuristic — "possible
  Feature Envy" — never a hard violation. Skip anything tooling already enforces.

Each entry reads _what it is_ → _how to fix_. Match it against the diff.

- **Mysterious Name** — a function, variable, or type whose name does not reveal
  what it does or holds. → rename it; where no honest name comes, the design is
  murky.
- **Duplicated Code** — the same logic shape appears in more than one hunk or file
  in the change. → extract the shared shape, call it from both.
- **Feature Envy** — a method that reaches into another object's data more than its
  own. → move the method onto the data it envies.
- **Data Clumps** — the same few fields or parameters keep travelling together, a
  type wanting to be born. → bundle them into one type, pass that.
- **Primitive Obsession** — a primitive or string standing in for a domain concept
  that deserves its own type. → give the concept its own small type.
- **Repeated Switches** — the same switch or if-cascade on the same type recurs
  across the change. → replace with polymorphism, or one map both sites share.
- **Shotgun Surgery** — one logical change forces scattered edits across many files
  in the diff. → gather what changes together into one module.
- **Divergent Change** — one file or module is edited for several unrelated
  reasons. → split so each module changes for one reason.
- **Speculative Generality** — abstraction, parameters, or hooks added for needs
  the specification does not have. → delete it; inline back until a real need
  shows.
- **Message Chains** — long `a.b().c().d()` navigation the caller should not depend
  on. → hide the walk behind one method on the first object.
- **Middle Man** — a class or function that mostly just delegates onward. → cut it,
  call the real target direct.
- **Refused Bequest** — a subclass or implementer that ignores or overrides most of
  what it inherits. → drop the inheritance, use composition.
