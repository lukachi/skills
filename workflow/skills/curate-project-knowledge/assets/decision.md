# Context and problem

Explain the situation and the problem that required a decision.[^maintainer-decision-id]

# Product decision

State the exact stakeholder-visible choice and its boundaries in plain
language.

# Rationale

Explain why this option was chosen.

# Alternatives

List material alternatives and why they were not selected.

# Consequences and tradeoffs

State benefits, costs, risks, constraints, and accepted tradeoffs. Link
engineering knowledge for technical consequences instead of embedding an
implementation walkthrough.

# Affected knowledge

Link every materially affected Area, capability, use case, rule, engineering
concept, or contract. Record non-lineage semantic edges in `x-wf.relations`
with the same target and meaningful context.

# Transition and migration

Explain the product transition and link separate engineering migration detail,
or state `None`.

# Unresolved questions

List remaining questions, or state `None`.

# Evolution

Explain what this changes relative to each predecessor. Use project-relative
`knowledge/...` paths in `supersedes` and `superseded_by`; keep reciprocal
links accurate and include matching links to every predecessor and successor.

[^maintainer-decision-id]: Explicit maintainer approval in the linked decision receipt.

Before changing `status` to `stable`, invoke `verify-knowledge-quality`, run
`wfctl knowledge hash --concept knowledge/.../<decision>.md`, and bind both
the passed quality receipt and human verification to the returned hash.
