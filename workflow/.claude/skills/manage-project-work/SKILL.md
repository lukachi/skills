description: "Classify and route project work through the central knowledge-backed workflow. Use when a requested feature, fix, refactor, migration, investigation, operational change, product decision, or architecture change may be significant; when resuming active work after interruption; or when a useful lightweight result has no active or curated owner yet. This is the default project-work router: it decides between lightweight work, a pending capture, a bounded change, and deliberate Wayfinder, then maintains the owning active checkpoint."

# Manage Project Work

Choose the least expensive path that preserves important intent, progress, and
evidence. Operate `wfctl` yourself; the maintainer supplies product authority,
corrections, and review decisions rather than managing files or commands.

## Route the request

Treat work as significant when it may change observable behavior, domain
meaning, a contract, state, security, reliability, operations, architecture,
ownership, or cross-repository coordination. Size alone is not decisive.

- **Lightweight:** clearly local and behavior-preserving. Work directly. Offer
  a pending capture only when a non-obvious reusable result should survive and
  no active change or curated concept already owns it.
- **Bounded significant change:** the outcome can be specified honestly now.
  Start one central bundle and use `specify-project-change`.
- **Wayfinder:** a consequential destination is visible, but dependent product
  or architecture choices make an honest spec impossible across one session.
  Recommend `shape-project-direction`; enter only after maintainer agreement.

If classification is genuinely ambiguous, explain the material risk, recommend
one route, and ask for the maintainer's choice. Do not force full ceremony onto
trivial work or hide a significant change as lightweight.

## Start one canonical bundle

Create the bundle before extended significant-task discussion so the reasoning
survives compaction:

```sh
wfctl work start <slug> --title "<title>" --mode full|slice|wayfinder
```

Start from one leaf for single-repository delivery. Start from knowledge with
no leaf for project-only work, or repeat `--leaf` for known multi-repository
scope. Do not bind guessed leaves merely because Wayfinder may need them later.
Work that turns out to need one gains it later with `wfctl work bind <id>`, run
from that repository's own checkout.

Run `wfctl work status <id>` and `wfctl work context <id> --stage shape`.
Use the returned bundle in knowledge for records and only the returned code
roots for implementation. Never create a competing spec or issue tracker in a
leaf.

## Persist material change and discovery

A turn is material whether it comes from the maintainer or the agent. It is
material when it changes a requirement, constraint, idea, alternative,
decision, rejection, deferral, scope boundary, evidence, risk, question, next
action, or the agent's understanding of the work.

Before continuing, apply this preservation test:

> If this newly learned information disappeared, could a fresh session repeat
> material investigation, choose differently, misunderstand the work, or act
> unsafely?

If yes, append a complete entry to the owning record's `Discovery ledger`.
Record the observation, evidence or missing evidence, implication, applicable
scope or lifetime, and current disposition. Do not constrain discoveries to a
fixed taxonomy. Use the claimed issue during execution, `change.md` during
shaping/direct work/final review, or a linked artifact when the supporting
material is too large; the owning ledger must link that artifact. If the
discovery changes parent scope, acceptance, or decisions, update `change.md`
as well. Preserve invalidated discoveries with a corrected disposition rather
than erasing them.

Then update the rest of the semantic record and checkpoint:

1. append a concise proposed, approved, rejected, deferred, or superseded
   decision-ledger entry when a choice changed;
2. update affected current state, scope, acceptance, issues, decisions,
   progress, evidence, and discovery implications;
3. preserve rationale without copying the chat transcript or turning the
   discovery ledger into an activity log;
4. run `wfctl work checkpoint <id>` for bundle-level work, or add
   `--issue <issue-id>` for a claimed issue. Supply current state, last
   completed action, exact next action, blockers, and actor.

The checkpoint may mention a discovery ID and its effect on the frontier, but
must not duplicate the discovery. If useful material has no active or curated
owner, follow the pending-capture route instead.

New bundle schemas require the ledger section. When an entry exists, workflow
context validates its stable `DISC-*` ID and non-empty observation, evidence,
implication, scope, and disposition. Fix malformed entries before continuing;
do not satisfy the gate with placeholders.

The checkpoint hash binds the record after those edits. Never edit its YAML by
hand. If any owned record changes afterward, `wfctl work context` reports the
checkpoint stale and the agent must refresh it before claiming or closing work.

After compaction, interruption, or a clean-session start, first run `wfctl work
context --stage resume` without an ID. It auto-selects only when exactly one
active record is bound to the current checkout. If none exists, do not invent
one. If several exist, run `wfctl work status`, present their human outcomes,
and ask the maintainer which one to resume; never guess from recency, branch, or
directory name.

For the selected record, inspect status and the reported checkpoints, then
read every required file completely, including the entire discovery ledger,
before acting. Continue only in the exact reported code roots and existing
claim. If a binding or checkpoint is invalid, stop and reconcile it rather
than reconstructing state from chat memory. A checkpoint locates the frontier;
it never replaces the required full reads.

If an upgraded legacy bundle has no structured checkpoint, read its current
record and former Progress/Handoff sections completely, then run `wfctl work
checkpoint` once to adopt the new model. Preserve the old prose as lineage, but
do not maintain a second resume state afterward.

If a pre-ledger bundle has no `Discovery ledger`, do not fabricate past
discoveries. Add the section when material work next changes that owner and
preserve new discoveries from that point forward; old bundle versions remain
readable for compatibility.

## Route the active bundle

- Use `grill-project-decisions` before either shaping or specifying settles
  anything. It is the interview: the whole frontier of open decisions asked in
  numbered rounds, each with a recommendation, until the maintainer says you have
  reached a shared understanding. Nothing is written into the contract before they
  say it. Pair it with `model-project-domain`, which keeps the project's own words
  sharp while the interview runs — `grill-me` is the maintainer's own way in.
- Use `shape-project-direction` only for deliberate Wayfinder.
- Use `specify-project-change` to synthesize bounded work or collapse a clear
  map into stable acceptance criteria. It synthesizes what the interview already
  settled and starts no interview of its own.
- Use `split-project-change` when approved work needs several dependency-aware
  sessions.
- Use `implement-work-item` for exactly one frontier issue. A small bounded
  change may be implemented directly from `change.md` after framing approval,
  while preserving the same workspace and progress rules.
- Use `verify-project-work` for complete file accounting, spec/implementation
  reconciliation, drafting the curated pages, closure, and promotion.

A framing is recorded with `wfctl work approve <id> --stage framing --by
human:<maintainer-id>`, and a promotion with `wfctl work promote <id> --by
human:<maintainer-id>`, never by editing `maintainer_review` directly. Record
what they answered in the session with `--attested "<their words>" --session
"<where>"`; a typed confirmation and an out-of-band `--token` remain for a
maintainer who wants a receipt you could not have written. A hand-written receipt
fails the completion gate. Closure itself asks them nothing — that is the tool's
to check, and a completion approval is required only where delivery no longer
matches the framing they approved.

`changes/active/<id>/` is already the knowledge-side living record. There is
no final dump into `raw/`. Closure moves the entire bundle intact to
`changes/promotion/<id>/` while its drafted pages wait on the maintainer, and to
`changes/archive/<id>/` once they land or once there are none.

## Pending capture

Do not create a capture when an active change, issue, intake case,
reconstruction, or curated concept already owns the material; update that owner
and its checkpoint instead. When useful lightweight material genuinely has no
owner and the maintainer accepts retaining it, run:

```sh
wfctl work capture add <slug> --title "<fact to retain>"
```

Complete the returned pending capture. It remains non-authoritative until the
knowledge agent routes it to a real destination or discards it through
`wfctl work capture resolve`. Never copy active progress into `changes/inbox/`
and never cite raw or intake material as current truth.
