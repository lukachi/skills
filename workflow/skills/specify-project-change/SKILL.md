name: specify-project-change
description: Synthesize an already-discussed bounded change, or a resolved Wayfinder map, into the one central project specification. Use when the maintainer explicitly asks to write or refresh the spec, when a direction map is ready to become delivery work, or before splitting approved work into issues. Do not use to discover a huge unresolved direction, implement code, or create a second specification outside the active knowledge bundle.

# Specify Project Change

Turn the context already earned through discussion, curated knowledge, and
source inspection into one buildable contract. Do not restart an interview or
discard decisions merely because a fresh template would be easier.

Read [the specification contract](references/specification-contract.md) before
editing the bundle.

## Bind and read

1. Resolve the active change ID. If no significant-work bundle exists, invoke
   `manage-project-work` to classify and start it first.
2. Run `wfctl work context <id> --stage shape`. For a resolved Wayfinder map,
   run `--stage review` so every map issue and artifact is enumerated.
3. Read every required file completely, including content below long tables or
   headings. Run `wfctl work review file <id> <path>` only after the whole file
   has been read and reconciled.
4. Run `wfctl work status <id>`. Treat `Spec` as the only editable
   specification and every `Code root` as an exact evidence workspace, never
   as a path inferred from repository name.

## Synthesize, do not invent

Use the current discussion without asking the maintainer to repeat it. Reconcile
it with relevant curated knowledge and verified source reality. If code informs
the contract, invoke `analyze-with-graphify` in every relevant bound root, then
open the actual source locations. Invoke `align-project-knowledge` before
settling product or architecture meaning.

Update `change.md` with:

- the problem and intended observable outcome;
- actors, current behavior, constraints, and explicit exclusions;
- approved product and engineering decisions with rationale;
- stable acceptance entries `AC-01`, `AC-02`, ... in frontmatter;
- the highest practical test seams and what behavior each seam proves;
- unresolved authority or facts, without guessing them away;
- the current ledger and structured resumable checkpoint.

Acceptance criteria describe observable outcomes and boundary behavior, not a
file-by-file implementation plan. Preserve an ID when wording improves without
changing meaning. Retire or supersede changed meaning explicitly.

Ask at most one blocking question at a time. Include verified facts, the
decision it unlocks, viable choices, and a recommendation. Persist the answer
before continuing. After each material edit or maintainer answer, refresh the
bundle checkpoint with `wfctl work checkpoint <id>`; run it last so its hash
binds the current `change.md` rather than an earlier draft.

## Review and continue

Present a compact framing packet: outcome, scope, exclusions, decisions,
acceptance IDs, test seams, risks, and unresolved work. Record only explicit
maintainer approval under `maintainer_review.framing`.

For Wayfinder, read every resolved issue in full, collapse its linked detail
into the specification, clear all legitimate fog, review every current bundle
file, then run:

```sh
wfctl work map finish <id> --mode full|slice
```

The map remains as history; it is not copied into a parallel strategy file.
After approval, invoke `split-project-change` when the work needs multiple
fresh sessions. A small bounded change may remain entirely in `change.md`.
