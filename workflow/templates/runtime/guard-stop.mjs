// Stop hook. Autonomous work dies when a turn ends while nothing is blocked:
// nothing failed, the transcript simply stops, and hours pass before anyone
// notices. Instructions do not fix it — the managed agent block already says to
// continue and is ignored. What fixes it is costing the model another turn,
// because inside that turn the next action is the cheapest thing to do.
//
// The question asked is whether the agent is waiting on the maintainer, not
// what its last message said. Framing it around a stated next action missed the
// larger half of the failure: a turn that ends on "the work continues by
// itself" or "the rest can wait" announces nothing, blocks on nothing, and
// parks just as completely.
//
// This never decides whether the work is done. It reports what the turn ended
// with and what the repository says is outstanding, and hands the judgment
// back. Deciding completion here is exactly how a Stop hook burns a session:
// a hook that keeps answering "not finished" forces turns the model cannot
// satisfy until the token cap ends it.
//
// The bound is progress rather than a single re-entry. One re-entry was the
// first attempt and it was too weak: an agent re-entered once, did real work,
// stopped again, and the second stop passed unconditionally, so the run parked
// itself for the night with the frontier still full. Progress is observable
// without judging anything — the state report either moved between two stops or
// it did not — so re-entry continues while the repository keeps changing and
// releases the moment it stops, under a hard ceiling that guarantees the turn
// always ends.
