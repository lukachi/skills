# Report a background command that has gone silent. Never decide for the agent.
#
# Duration is the wrong test: a talkative hour-long build is healthy and a
# silent loop is not. Silence only means nobody can tell from out here, so this
# reports and exits while the child keeps running. Exiting is the point — a
# finished background task is the only channel that reaches a working agent.
#
# The child writes to a regular file, never to a pipe. A stalled writer on a
# pipe blocks whoever reads it, which is how an earlier version of this script
# hung in exactly the way it exists to catch.
