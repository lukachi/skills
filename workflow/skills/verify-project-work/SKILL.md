name: verify-project-work
description: Verify a significant project change against every file in its central bundle, every stable acceptance ID, and every exact bound source revision without hiding gaps. Use before claiming a bounded change, slice, multi-repository delivery, project-only decision, or architecture change complete; before knowledge promotion; or when auditing an implementation against its approved contract.

# Verify Project Work

Completion is a claim supported by complete accounting and fresh semantic
evidence. Structural green output is never proof by itself.

Read [the completion gate](references/completion-gate.md) before recording final
receipts.

## Account for the whole bundle

1. Run `wfctl work status <id>` and stop on any checkout, branch, worktree, or
   binding mismatch.
2. Run `wfctl work context <id> --stage review`.
3. Read every required file completely, including long issue tails and every
   artifact that informs the result. Mark only a genuinely irrelevant
   supporting artifact `irrelevant`, with a reason.
4. After each read, record `wfctl work review file <id> <path>`. Re-read and
   refresh a receipt whenever the file changes.
5. Run `wfctl work review status <id>` and require zero unseen,
   changed-after-review, or invalid files.

## Review on independent axes

**Contract axis:** map every stable acceptance ID to non-dropped issues,
production behavior, direct evidence, and a verification receipt. Find missing
requirements, partial behavior, scope creep, and implementation that appears
present but contradicts the contract.

**Engineering axis:** inspect the real diff and production path in every exact
code root. Invoke Graphify-first analysis, then open actual source, callers,
boundaries, state, errors, and consumers. Check project standards, architecture,
security, operations, and maintainability independently of whether the spec was
followed.

Run focused behavior checks and the broader relevant test, build, type, lint,
and runtime checks. Expected values must come from the contract or an
independent authority, not the implementation. Look adversarially for disabled
paths, placeholders, mocks, fixtures, temporary compatibility code, unhandled
branches, and silently deferred work.

Record one exact repository/revision/worktree receipt per bound leaf. Require a
clean commit containing the reviewed implementation; obtain normal maintainer
authorization before committing. For project-only work, verify decisions,
knowledge, and links without inventing code evidence.

## Promote and close

Decide whether verified durable truth changed. If yes, route product behavior
and engineering realization through their separate curation skills, run the
two-axis knowledge quality gate, validate every changed concept, and list exact
concepts under `knowledge_promotion`. Otherwise record a concrete no-update
reason.

Account for what this work decided before it closes. Every answer the maintainer
gave is recorded verbatim in this bundle, and closure is the last moment it can
reach a page rather than an archive:

```sh
wfctl work decisions <id>
wfctl work decisions <id> --what "<the decision>" --said "<where they said it>" \
  --promoted knowledge/decisions/<slug>.md
```

`--folded <concept>` when an existing page already carries it, `--not-durable`
with a reason when it settles nothing beyond this work, and `--none "<why>"` when
the whole bundle settled nothing. A resolved Wayfinder map is checked against, so
an answer it recorded cannot archive unaccounted for.

Nothing here asks the maintainer anything. They decided already; this records
where their answer now lives. What does reach them is one confirmation, not one
per decision: the pages are drafted from their own words, and the question is
whether the rendering is faithful — asked once, with named exceptions, as
`maintainer-review` requires of confirming written records.

A concept promoted from a bundle in a project with no reconstructed baseline
carries the same shape as one established by whole-project reading and a much
narrower footing: it was derived from whatever this task happened to touch. Say
so in its `maintainer-decision` source — name the bundle and state that no
reconstruction has covered this subject — so a later baseline knows to re-derive
it rather than treat it as already settled. Promote it anyway: knowledge grown
from real work is better than none, and the cost of the shortcut is only hidden
when nobody writes it down.

Render the completion decision with `wfctl work ask <id> --stage completion`
rather than composing one. It carries the four things accepting one fixes —
what the work does now, what it still does not do, what closing it takes on,
and what the project now says that it did not — and reaches them from the
record's own results and their own answers. Everything else you accounted for
above is the evidence behind those four, and stays where an audit can reach it.

The render is only as honest as what it reads. An unresolved risk nobody wrote
into `verification.unresolved` or the record's uncertainty section does not
appear, and a criterion left `pending` because nobody checked reads exactly like
one that failed. Fix the record, then render again; a packet edited by hand is
back to being composed.

Record the maintainer's explicit decision through the approval command; never
write the receipt by hand:

```sh
wfctl work approve <id> --stage completion \
  --by human:<maintainer-id> \
  --note "<what the maintainer accepted>"
```

Record what they answered with `--attested "<their words>" --session
"<where>"`; a typed confirmation and a `--token` matching `WFCTL_APPROVAL_TOKEN`
remain for a stronger record. `wfctl work verify` rejects a receipt with no
matching approval record. Finish all semantic edits to `change.md`, then refresh its
checkpoint in review stage **before** recording the final hash receipt:

```sh
wfctl work checkpoint <id> \
  --actor "agent:<identity>" \
  --stage review \
  --state "Final verification and maintainer decision are recorded." \
  --last "Reconciled acceptance, implementation, and knowledge promotion." \
  --next "Re-read changed bundle files, refresh their receipts, and run the completion gate."
```

Re-read `change.md` completely after that command and refresh its receipt, plus
every other file changed by the review. Require a current checkpoint and zero
unseen, changed-after-review, or invalid files. Then run:

```sh
wfctl work verify <id>
wfctl work close <id> --outcome completed|partial|abandoned
```

Use the honest outcome. Completed closure fails on open issues or claims,
unresolved Wayfinder state, acceptance gaps, stale file receipts, dirty or
mismatched source revisions, a stale checkpoint, missing evidence, or
incomplete promotion. Closing the bundle makes its checkpoint terminal; do not
create a capture for this completed session state.
