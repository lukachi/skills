name: curate-product-knowledge
description: Create and update stakeholder-facing current product knowledge in a workflow knowledge repository. Use whenever an agent promotes, explains, rewrites, or reviews an Area, capability, use case, product flow, domain concept, product rule, vision statement, delivery summary, or evolution summary for product managers, clients, domain experts, or other nontechnical readers. Separate accepted intent from observed delivery, keep implementation details in linked engineering documents, preserve important rules and exceptions, and never present planned or uncertain behavior as currently available.

# Curate Product Knowledge

Write the product view of verified project truth. Make it understandable to a
client or product manager without requiring source code, API, architecture, or
repository knowledge.

Read [the product writing contract](references/product-writing-contract.md)
before authoring or materially rewriting a product document. Use
[the product concept template](assets/product-concept.md) for a new concept.

## Establish authority

1. Work from the knowledge root and identify the primary Area.
2. Read the relevant Area index, product concepts, current decisions, and
   linked engineering concepts in full.
3. Separate:
   - accepted intent and product meaning;
   - currently observed delivery;
   - alignment or drift between them;
   - planned, rejected, superseded, and unknown claims.
4. Require explicit maintainer authority for intent, product meaning, rules,
   normative ownership, and product decisions.
5. Require pinned source and fresh checks for delivery claims. Invoke
   `analyze-with-graphify` in every relevant exact leaf before direct source
   and test inspection.
6. Never use raw, intake, search results, a compiled graph, or agent prose as
   authority.

## Author the product view

1. Declare `view: product`, `purpose: current-behavior`, and include
   `stakeholder` in `audience`.
2. State the current answer first. Explain what the product provides, who it
   serves, observable behavior, rules, outcomes, boundaries, exceptions,
   delivery state, examples, and meaningful evolution.
3. Use the vocabulary a domain expert or client would use. Explain necessary
   domain terms on first use.
4. Describe outcomes and behavior, not classes, functions, endpoints, schemas,
   storage, messages, packages, repositories, or source paths.
5. Keep `Engineering details` link-only. Put technical explanations in a
   document authored with `curate-engineering-knowledge`.
6. Use present tense only for behavior supported by the declared delivery
   state. Say plainly when a capability is absent, partial, retired, unknown,
   or accepted but not yet available.
7. Preserve material exceptions and conditions. Plain language may simplify
   wording but must not simplify away meaning.
8. Keep current truth at one stable path. When a decision changes, update the
   current product explanation and link the decision lineage; do not copy the
   whole Area into version folders.
9. Attribute every material claim to an authoritative source with matching
   source IDs and footnotes. Do not expose machine-local paths.

## Area indexes

Treat `knowledge/areas/<area>/index.md` as the primary stakeholder page for an
Area. Use the Area template owned by `curate-project-knowledge`. Keep it
product-first and bounded:

- summarize rather than flatten every child document;
- link capabilities, use cases, rules, current decisions, and evolution;
- show delivery honestly;
- keep `Engineering details` as links with short nontechnical labels.

## Verify before stable

1. Invoke `verify-knowledge-quality` after the substantive body is complete.
2. Resolve every failed or uncertain rubric item.
3. Run `wfctl knowledge hash --concept <path>` and bind both the semantic
   quality receipt and normal verification to that content hash.
4. Use `status: stable` only after the quality receipt is current, all
   authority requirements pass, and normative claims have human verification.
5. Run `wfctl knowledge validate`, `wfctl knowledge build`, and `qmd update`.
6. Do not report completion while any gate fails.
