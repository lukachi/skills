## Project workflow

This block is managed by `wfctl`. Read `.workflow/config.json` and all files under `.workflow/rules/` before project work. Use `PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md` as the maintainer-facing contract for review gates.

- Invoke `analyze-with-graphify` before inspecting, searching, planning,
  changing, debugging, reviewing, or verifying source code, even when the
  maintainer does not mention Graphify.
- Require that skill to confirm and invoke the official native `graphify` skill
  exposed in the current session before project analysis continues.
- Treat Graphify as the primary source-code navigation tool; text search is
  supplementary and direct source inspection is authoritative.
- Do not use Graphify as the primary analyzer for Markdown intake or curated
  knowledge.
- Use QMD from the knowledge repository for Markdown retrieval. Treat its
  index, ranking, and snippets as navigation only; verify by direct reading and
  authoritative sources.
- Present bounded review packets and require explicit maintainer decisions at the gates defined by the workflow.
- Ask one material question at a time, include a recommendation, and update
  the durable record before continuing.
- Preserve uncertainty and report missing evidence instead of guessing.
- Execute required `wfctl` commands yourself when tool access permits. Do not
  delegate routine CLI operation, spec editing, or record maintenance to the
  maintainer; ask them for decisions, approval, or missing authority.
- Treat the maintainer's natural-language request as the user interface.
  Outside bootstrap or explicit troubleshooting, never require them to know a
  subcommand, record ID, generated path, QMD query, Graphify invocation, or
  structured-file schema. Resolve those mechanics yourself.
- When internal state offers one safe valid continuation, announce it and
  continue. When several materially different choices remain, present their
  human meaning, evidence, and recommendation; after the maintainer chooses,
  execute the corresponding commands yourself.
- For significant multi-turn work, create the central bundle early and update
  it after every material maintainer turn. On resume, ask `wfctl work context`
  for the stage-specific inventory, read every required file completely, and
  recover from the bundle and exact claim rather than conversation memory.
- Do not create a competing leaf-local spec or issue tracker. Claim one central
  frontier issue from the exact bound checkout before implementation. Before
  completion, account for every bundle file at its current hash; a receipt
  proves accounting, not comprehension.
- Treat the maintainer/product and engineering roads as linked, first-class
  views of the same project, never one blended document and never one derived
  from the other. Product pages explain current behavior to stakeholders;
  engineering pages explain implementation to engineers and operators.
  Decision lineage connects both roads rather than forming a third flat view.
- Route broad project discovery, newcomer onboarding, Area exploration, and
  focused product-understanding questions to `explore-project-knowledge`.
  Exploration is read-only: answer progressively from curated knowledge
  without requiring the user to know Areas, capability names, or file paths.
- Route product authoring to `curate-product-knowledge`, technical authoring to
  `curate-engineering-knowledge`, and every material knowledge edit through
  `verify-knowledge-quality` before it becomes stable. Keep authority/truth
  and reader communication as separate semantic passes.
